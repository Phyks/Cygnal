API
===

The server part exposes a public API (by default). Read from the API is always
public but writing new reports can be restricted through the use of an
API token (see the doc about deployment for more infos).

A helper script is available under `scripts/api_doc.py` to export a
documentation of the available API endpoints and usage in the current version
of the code.
